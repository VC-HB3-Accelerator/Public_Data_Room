### 1.2. VC HB3 Accelerator Project

**Status:** Venture fund and software provider, in the process of registration in special economic zones of regulators.

**Copyright Transfer:** The author will transfer copyright to the DLE software to the VC HB3 Accelerator project after registration of the fund management smart contract in the regulator zone.

**Regulator Integration:**

The fund interacts with regulators in special economic zones in two directions:

1. **Technical Integration:** The fund receives from regulators a set of legal entity identifiers (legal address, business activity code, etc.) and integrates them into the DLE application. The application implements a form for selecting identifiers for multi-deployment of smart contracts linked to a specific regulator.

2. **Infrastructure Integration:** The fund invests profits in creating custom L2 chains for each individual regulator, ensuring compliance with local regulatory requirements and creating regulated infrastructure for asset tokenization.

**Fund Team:**

**Founder:** Alexander Viktorovich Tarabanov — digital nomad, entrepreneur working remotely and moving between various jurisdictions.

**AI Assistant:** Code and documentation generation, scaling development processes.

**Token Holders:** Clients and contractors responsible for personalized software configuration for specific client and jurisdiction requirements.

**Fund Mission:** Opening VC HB3 Accelerator offices in special economic zones of regulators worldwide. This includes:
- Establishing partnerships with regulators in various jurisdictions
- Creating infrastructure for launching Layer 2 networks in special economic zones
- Deploying the DLE platform in new regions considering local regulatory requirements
- Forming an asset tokenization ecosystem in cooperation with local regulators
- Developing the VC HB3 Accelerator office network for global platform scaling
