## Financial Model

### Profit Distribution (15% / 15% / 70%)

**15% — Dividends to Token Holders:**
- Distribution proportional to ownership share
- Payments from all treasury receipts
- Ensures returns for investors

**15% — Expenses:**

**70% — Startup Investments:**
- Selection of 600 companies from accelerator participants over 5 years

- In exchange for portfolio company governance tokens
- **Goal:** Collect and sell portfolio over 5 years to launch next accelerator

### Liquidity Provision and Token Price Growth

- Investors receive capital gains when selling tokens

**Treasury Balance:**
- Entire treasury balance ensures liquidity of 3,000,000 governance tokens
- Treasury balance guarantees ability to exchange governance tokens for stablecoins
- Transparent governance system through smart contracts

**Treasury Balance Growth Sources:**

2. Receipts from portfolio company governance token sales (exits)
3. Capital raised from LP investors
4. Reinvestment of portfolio company profits

---

## Business Model and Fund Revenue Sources

### 1. DLE Software License Sales

**Pricing Plans:** Standard (1,000 USDT) and Premium (10,000 USDT). For more details: [business-model.md](business-model.md#1-dle-software-license-sales)

### 2. Portfolio Company Governance Token Sales (Exits)

**Strategy:**
- Portfolio companies deploy governance tokens in their software
- In exchange for investments, startups transfer governance tokens to the fund
- Governance tokens are sold upon investment exit (exits)

**Metrics Based on Competitor Analysis:**
- **Exit Rate:** 10-20% of portfolio companies successfully exit (sale, IPO, acquisition)
- **Average Return from Successful Exits:** 10-15x of initial investment
- **Time to Exit:** 3-7 years (average 5 years)
- **Return Distribution:** 80% of returns come from 20% of successful companies

**Investment and Exit Time Structure:**

**Fund Goal:** Over 5 years, collect and sell portfolio of 600 companies to launch next accelerator.

**Investment and Exit Schedule by Year:**

**Year 1 (Q4 2025 - Q4 2026):**
- Entrepreneur recruitment: 21,000 first accelerator entrepreneurs
- Investments: Selection and investments in first 100-120 portfolio companies
- Investment stages: Pre-seed, Seed
- Exits: 0 (too early for exits)
- Focus: Portfolio formation, selection of best accelerator participants

**Forecast by End of Year 5 (Q1 2030 - Q4 2030):**
- Investments: Final investments up to 600 companies
- Investment stages: Series A, ICO
- Exits: Main wave of exits (4-5 years after investment)
  - Expected number: 40-80 companies (20% of those invested)
  - Average return: 10-15x
  - Treasury receipts: Maximum returns
- **Goal:** Collect and sell portfolio to launch next accelerator

**Investment Size:**

**Initial Investment Capital:**
- Initial treasury balance: 984,000,000 USDT
- Distribution: 15% dividends / 15% expenses / 70% investments
- Investment capital: 984,000,000 × 70% = 688,800,000 USDT

**Additional Capital from Receipts:**
- Receipts from license sales: 70% goes to treasury, then 70% of that to investments
- Receipts from exits: 70% goes to treasury, then 70% of that to investments
- Profit reinvestment increases investment capital

**Average Investment Size per Portfolio Company:**
- **Pre-seed:** 50,000 - 200,000 USDT
- **Seed:** 200,000 - 1,000,000 USDT
- **Series A:** 1,000,000 - 5,000,000 USDT
- **ICO:** 500,000 - 2,000,000 USDT
- **Average Investment:** 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 USDT (for accelerator)

**Capital Distribution Among 600 Companies:**
- Total investment capital: ~1,200,000,000 - 1,500,000,000 USDT (considering reinvestment)
- Average investment: 1,200,000,000 / 600 = 2,000,000 USDT per company
- Or: 1,500,000,000 / 600 = 2,500,000 USDT per company

**Investment Strategy:**
- **Selection from Accelerator:** Fund selects best acceleration program participants
- **Stages:** From Pre-seed to ICO
- **Focus:** Companies using DLE platform for asset tokenization
- **Diversification:** Investments in different stages and industries
- **Size:** Flexible approach depending on stage and company potential

**Impact of Time Structure on Treasury Balance:**

**Year 1:**
- Treasury balance: 984,000,000 USDT (initial)
- Investments: 688,800,000 USDT (70% of initial balance)
- Receipts from licenses: Begin to arrive
- Exits: 0
- Minimum token price: Grows from license receipts

**Forecast by End of Year 5:**
- Treasury balance: Significant growth from license receipts and main wave of exits
- Investments: Completion of investments up to 600 companies
- Exits: Main wave of exits significantly increases treasury balance
- Minimum token price: Maximum growth from exits
- **Goal:** Collect and sell portfolio to launch next accelerator

**Potential:**
- Goal: 600 portfolio companies over 5 years
- Selection: From accelerator participants (21,000+ entrepreneurs)
- Stages: From Pre-seed to ICO
- Expected number of successful exits: 60-120 companies (10-20%)
- Time structure: Exits occur over 5 years, main wave in years 4-5
- Diversified governance token portfolio
- Value growth as portfolio companies develop
- **Result:** Collect and sell portfolio to launch next accelerator

### 3. Capital Raised from LP Investors

**Mechanics:**
- LPs can purchase up to 30% of fund governance tokens
- Price: $1,000 per token
- Raised capital goes to treasury balance

**Potential:**
- Maximum: 30% of 3,000,000 tokens = 900,000 tokens
- Potential capital: up to 900,000,000 USDT

### Brief Summary

**Five Sources of Value for Investors:** See "Revenue Sources" section above.

**Key Conclusions from Calculations:**

> ⚠️ **Important:** All forecasts are a vision of the future, not a guarantee. The probability of achieving optimistic forecasts may be very low (less than 10%). It is recommended to focus on conservative scenarios when making investment decisions. For more details, see [DISCLAIMERS.md](DISCLAIMERS.md#forecasts-and-vision-of-the-future).

**Conservative Scenario (10% of 333M entrepreneurs by year 5) — MORE REALISTIC:**
- At minimum price sale: **2,485% profit (~65%+ annually)** ⚠️
- At market price sale: **20,268% profit (~400%+ annually)** ⚠️
- **Probability:** Medium (30-50%)
- **Recommendation:** Use this scenario as baseline when evaluating investments

**Optimistic Scenario (40% of 333M entrepreneurs by year 5, exit rate 10%) — UNLIKELY:**
- At minimum price sale: **10,417% profit (~90%+ annually)** ⚠️
- At market price sale: **151,667% profit (~800%+ annually)** ⚠️
- **Probability:** Low (10-20%)
- **Recommendation:** Consider as maximum possible scenario, not as expected result

**Very Optimistic Scenario (40% of 333M entrepreneurs by year 5, exit rate 20%) — VERY UNLIKELY:**
- At minimum price sale: **10,525% profit (~90%+ annually)** ⚠️
- At market price sale: **251,686% profit (~1200%+ annually)** ⚠️
- **Probability:** Very low (less than 10%)
- **Recommendation:** Consider as vision of the future, not as realistic forecast

**Important:**
- Market token price accounts for future profit from accelerator and can be 6-9 times higher than minimum price (treasury-backed)
- Even in conservative scenario, investors can receive profitability exceeding target IRR of 20-30%
- **Actual results may differ significantly from all forecasts** — possibly tens or hundreds of times lower
- **All forecasts are a vision of the future, not a guarantee**

**Detailed Calculations and Examples:** See [financial-calculations.md](financial-calculations.md), including:
- Calculation methodology
- Treasury balance and token price calculation mechanism
- Token liquidity mechanism
- 5 detailed profitability calculation examples (10,000 USDT and 100,000 USDT, conservative and optimistic scenarios)
- Summary and key conclusions
