> ⚠️ **Important:** All forecasts are a vision of the future, not a guarantee. The probability of achieving optimistic forecasts may be very low (less than 10%). It is recommended to focus on conservative scenarios when making investment decisions. For more details, see [DISCLAIMERS.md](DISCLAIMERS.md#forecasts-and-vision-of-the-future).

## Calculation Methodology

**Five Sources of Value for Investors:**
1. Dividends from treasury receipts (15% of all receipts)
2. Token price growth (minimum and market price)
3. Portfolio company governance token portfolio
4. Access to DLE platform
5. Co-investment opportunities

## Treasury Balance and Token Price Calculation Mechanism

### Initial Conditions

- Total governance tokens: 3,000,000
- Available for LPs: 30% = 900,000 tokens
- **Sequence:**
  1. First, entrepreneurs purchase tokens (21,000 first accelerator entrepreneurs)
  2. Receipts from entrepreneurs: 84,000,000 USDT (minimum at full capacity)
  3. Then investors (LPs) purchase governance tokens

### Initial Treasury Balance

- From token sales to entrepreneurs: 84,000,000 USDT
- From governance token sales to LPs (30%): 900,000 × 1,000 = 900,000,000 USDT
- **Total: 984,000,000 USDT**

### Initial Token Price

- **Initial token price (treasury-backed): 984,000,000 / 3,000,000 = 328 USDT**
- **Primary sale price for LPs: 1,000 USDT per token**
- Premium at primary sale: 1,000 / 328 = 3.05x (premium for future growth)

### Treasury Balance Growth

- 70% of all receipts go to treasury (after 15% dividends and 15% expenses)
- Receipts include: license sales, portfolio company exits, additional LP investments

### Two Token Price Levels

#### 1. Minimum Price (Treasury-Backed)

- **Formula:** Minimum price = Treasury balance / 3,000,000
- Guarantees token liquidity
- Initial: 328 USDT (984,000,000 / 3,000,000)
  - Includes 84,000,000 USDT from token sales to first accelerator entrepreneurs
  - Includes 900,000,000 USDT from governance token sales to LP investors

#### 2. Market Price (Accounts for Future Profit)

- Can be significantly higher than minimum
- Accounts for future receipts from license sales and exits
- Example: if minimum price is 351,067 USDT (by year 5), market price can be 2,500,000 USDT (7x)
- Holders can sell tokens at market price on secondary market

---

## Token Liquidity Mechanism

### Treasury Token Buyback

**Buyback Mechanism:**
- Investor can sell tokens back to treasury at minimum price (treasury-backed)
- Minimum price = Treasury balance / 3,000,000 tokens
- Treasury guarantees token buyback at minimum price to ensure liquidity
- Buyback procedure: Investor initiates buyback request through smart contract

**Buyback Conditions:**
- Buyback is executed at minimum price (treasury-backed)
- Treasury balance ensures ability to buy back all tokens
- Buyback occurs in stablecoins (USDT)
- Transparent system through smart contracts

### Lock-Up Period

**Minimum Holding Period:**
- **Lock-up period: 12 months (1 year)** from token purchase date
- During lock-up period, investor cannot sell tokens back to treasury
- Lock-up period applies only to treasury buyback, not to secondary market sales

**Purpose of Lock-Up Period:**
- Ensuring fund stability in early years
- Protection against short-term speculation
- Guarantee of long-term investor participation in fund development

**After Lock-Up Period:**
- Investor can sell tokens back to treasury at minimum price
- Or sell tokens on secondary market at market price
- No restrictions on token transfer to third parties after lock-up period

### Secondary Token Market

**Secondary Market Mechanism:**
- Holders can sell tokens to third parties on secondary market
- Secondary market price is determined by supply and demand
- Market price can be significantly higher than minimum (accounts for future profit)
- No restrictions on token transfer after lock-up period

**Factors Affecting Market Price:**
1. **Expected Receipts from Accelerator:**
   - License sales forecast (21,000+ entrepreneurs)
   - Client growth and scaling

2. **Portfolio Company Exit Forecast:**
   - Expected number of successful exits (60-120 companies)
   - Average return from exits (10-15x)
   - Exit time structure (3-7 years)

3. **Treasury Balance Growth:**
   - Receipts from license sales
   - Receipts from portfolio company exits
   - Additional LP investments

4. **Additional Value:**
   - Access to DLE platform for digital asset management
   - Access to accelerator projects
   - Co-investment opportunities

**Market Price Multiplier:**
- Market price can be 6-9 times higher than minimum price
- Example: minimum price 351,067 USDT → market price 2,500,000 USDT (7x)
- Multiplier depends on investor expectations regarding future profit

### Token Transfer Restrictions

**During Lock-Up Period (12 months):**
- Cannot sell tokens back to treasury
- Can transfer tokens to third parties (secondary market sale)
- All token holder rights transfer to new owner

**After Lock-Up Period:**
- Can sell tokens back to treasury at minimum price
- Can sell tokens on secondary market at market price
- Can transfer tokens to third parties without restrictions

**Rights Transfer Procedure:**
- Token transfer occurs through blockchain
- All token holder rights (dividends, voting) transfer to new owner
- Transparent system through smart contracts

### Liquidity Provision with 70% Investments

**Liquidity Maintenance Mechanism:**
- Treasury balance constantly grows from license sales receipts
- 70% of receipts go to investments, but treasury balance does not decrease
- Receipts from portfolio company exits increase treasury balance
- Minimum token price is guaranteed by treasury balance

**Example:**
- Initial balance: 984,000,000 USDT
- Receipts from licenses: 261,130,800,000 USDT (70% goes to treasury)
- Added from exits: 482,160,000 USDT
- Treasury balance: 984,000,000 + 261,046,800,000 + 482,160,000 = 262,512,960,000 USDT
- Minimum price: 262,512,960,000 / 3,000,000 = 87,504.32 USDT

**Important:**
- Treasury balance ensures liquidity of all 3,000,000 tokens
- Investments do not decrease treasury balance, as they are funded from receipts
- Receipts from exits additionally increase treasury balance

- **Year 1: 84,000,000 USDT** (at full first accelerator capacity)

**Year 5: 40% of All Entrepreneurs Worldwide (133,200,000 entrepreneurs)**
- Distribution by pricing (assume 80% Standard, 20% Premium):
  - Standard: 106,560,000 × 1,000 USDT = 106,560,000,000 USDT
  - Premium: 26,640,000 × 10,000 USDT = 266,400,000,000 USDT

- **Your Token Value at Minimum Price: 10 × 87,504.32 = 875,043 USDT**
- **Your Token Value at Market Price: 10 × 1,500,000 = 15,000,000 USDT**
- **Capital Gain (Minimum): 875,043 - 10,000 = 865,043 USDT**
- **Capital Gain (Market): 15,000,000 - 10,000 = 14,990,000 USDT**

**4. Dividends over 5 Years:**
- From licenses (15%): 373,044,000,000 × 15% = 55,956,600,000 USDT

## Summary: Key Conclusions on Financial Model

**Accounted Revenue Sources:** See "Revenue Sources" section in [for-investors.md](for-investors.md#revenue-sources).

### Key Conclusions from Calculations

> ⚠️ **Important:** All forecasts are a vision of the future, not a guarantee. The probability of achieving optimistic forecasts may be very low (less than 10%). It is recommended to focus on conservative scenarios when making investment decisions. For more details, see [DISCLAIMERS.md](DISCLAIMERS.md#forecasts-and-vision-of-the-future).

**Conservative Scenario (10% of 333M entrepreneurs by year 5) — MORE REALISTIC:**
- At minimum price sale: **2,485% profit (~65%+ annually)** ⚠️
- At market price sale: **20,268% profit (~400%+ annually)** ⚠️
- **Probability:** Medium (30-50%)
- **Recommendation:** Use this scenario as baseline when evaluating investments

**Optimistic Scenario (40% of 333M entrepreneurs by year 5, exit rate 10%) — UNLIKELY:**
- At minimum price sale: **10,417% profit (~90%+ annually)** ⚠️
- At market price sale: **151,667% profit (~800%+ annually)** ⚠️
- **Probability:** Low (10-20%)
- **Recommendation:** Consider as maximum possible scenario, not as expected result

**Very Optimistic Scenario (40% of 333M entrepreneurs by year 5, exit rate 20%) — VERY UNLIKELY:**
- At minimum price sale: **10,525% profit (~90%+ annually)** ⚠️
- At market price sale: **251,686% profit (~1200%+ annually)** ⚠️
- **Probability:** Very low (less than 10%)
- **Recommendation:** Consider as vision of the future, not as realistic forecast (see [DISCLAIMERS.md](DISCLAIMERS.md#forecasts-and-vision-of-the-future))

**Important:**
- Market token price accounts for future profit from accelerator and can be 6-9 times higher than minimum price (treasury-backed)
- Even in conservative scenario, investors can receive profitability exceeding target IRR of 20-30%
- **Actual results may differ significantly from all forecasts** — possibly tens or hundreds of times lower
- **All forecasts are a vision of the future, not a guarantee**
