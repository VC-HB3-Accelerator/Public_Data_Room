## 💼 Business Risks

### Forecasts and Vision of the Future

**⚠️ CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: ALL FORECASTS ARE A VISION OF THE FUTURE, NOT A GUARANTEE**

The documents contain forecasts, including:
- 40% of all entrepreneurs worldwide by year 5 (133.2 million) — **THIS IS A VISION OF THE FUTURE, NOT A GUARANTEE**
- Profitability forecasts of 800%+ annually — **THIS IS A VISION OF THE FUTURE, NOT A GUARANTEE**
- Profit forecasts in trillions of USDT — **THIS IS A VISION OF THE FUTURE, NOT A GUARANTEE**

**Important to understand:**
- **All forecasts are a vision of the future**, based on optimistic assumptions about the technological revolution of asset tokenization
- **Forecasts are NOT a guarantee** of achieving the stated results
- **The probability of achieving optimistic forecasts may be very low** (less than 10%)
- **Actual results may differ significantly from forecasts** — possibly tens or hundreds of times lower
- **Alternative scenarios exist** with lower indicators (10%, 20% entrepreneurs), which are more realistic
- **Past performance does not guarantee future returns**
- **Investments involve high risks**, including the possibility of complete loss of invested funds

**It is recommended to:**
- Consider optimistic forecasts as **the maximum possible scenario**, not as an expected result
- Focus on **conservative scenarios** (10-20% entrepreneurs) when making investment decisions
- Understand that **actual results may be significantly lower** than even conservative forecasts

### No Guarantees of Success
