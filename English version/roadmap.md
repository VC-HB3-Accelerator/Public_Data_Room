## Overview

The roadmap describes the strategic development plan for VC HB3 Accelerator over the next 5 years through an iterative growth model: legal entity registration in a country → software deployment → marketing and sales → expansion to a new country from profits. Goal — achieving planned accelerator indicators (280 groups, 21,000+ entrepreneurs in first accelerator, **vision of the future:** 40% of all entrepreneurs worldwide by year 5 — see [forecasts and scenarios](for-investors.md#forecast-justification-from-conservative-10-to-optimistic-40-scenarios)), selection and investments in 600 portfolio companies from accelerator participants (stages from Pre-seed to ICO) — see [conservative scenarios](for-investors.md#example-4-investment-100-000-usdt-maximum-conservative-scenario-with-10-entrepreneurs-5-years), and creation of a global asset tokenization ecosystem.

> ⚠️ **Important:** All forecasts are a vision of the future, not a guarantee. For more details, see [DISCLAIMERS.md](DISCLAIMERS.md#forecasts-and-vision-of-the-future).

## Growth Model: Iterative Expansion Cycle

### Growth Cycle in Each Country

**Step 1: Legal Entity Registration**
- Registration of operator company in country (similar to LLC "ERAITI" in Russia)
- Obtaining necessary licenses and permits
- Creating local presence

**Step 2: Software Deployment**
- DLE platform deployment on local hosting provider servers
- Infrastructure configuration
- Preparation for sales

**Step 3: Marketing and Client Attraction**
- Launch of advertising campaigns for entrepreneurs
- Use of AI assistant to find companies by business activity type
- Personalized proposals to companies

**Step 4: Sales and Group Formation**
- Search for minimum 2+ software buyers per business activity type
- Group formation by business activity
- Company registration in VC HB3 Accelerator application groups
- DLE smart contract deployment for participants

**Step 5: Profit Reinvestment**
- From sales profits, legal entity registration in new country
- Cycle repetition until achieving planned accelerator indicators

**Step 6: Work with Regulator (After Gathering Groups)**
- Fund approaches local regulator with proposal
- Proposal: invest profits in creating local L2 chain
- Goal: tokenization of fund and legal entities using local identifiers
- Regulator provides set of identifiers (legal address, business activity code, etc.)
- Company adds identifiers to DLE application

**Step 7: Regulator Refusal Handling**
- If regulator refuses, refund conditions apply
- Alternative: token holders determine new path through on-chain voting
- Possible options: continue work without L2, search for alternative solutions, exit country
