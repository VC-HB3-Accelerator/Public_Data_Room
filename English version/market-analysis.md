## Forecast Justification: From Conservative (10%) to Optimistic (40%) Scenarios

> ⚠️ **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT:** All forecasts are a vision of the future, not a guarantee. Detailed disclaimers see [DISCLAIMERS.md](DISCLAIMERS.md#forecasts-and-vision-of-the-future).

### Important to Understand

- The 40% entrepreneur forecast is a **vision of the future**, based on the potential of the asset tokenization technological revolution, not a current traction forecast
- **Probability of achieving 40% is very low (less than 10%)**
- **More realistic is the conservative scenario (10% entrepreneurs)** with 30-50% probability
- **Actual results may be significantly lower** than even the conservative forecast
- **It is recommended to focus on conservative scenarios** when making investment decisions
