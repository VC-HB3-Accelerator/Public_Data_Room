## 2. Cooperation Proposal

### 2.1. Bilateral Cooperation

The fund offers regulators cooperation in two directions:

**1. Technical Integration:**
- Regulator provides a set of legal entity identifiers (legal address, business activity code, etc.)
- Fund integrates identifiers into the DLE application
- Creation of identifier selection form for multi-deployment of smart contracts linked to a specific regulator

**2. Infrastructure Integration:**
- Fund invests profits in creating a custom L2 chain for the regulator
- Creation of regulated infrastructure for tokenization of business assets and regulator money supply
- Ensuring compliance with local regulatory requirements

### 2.2. Conditions for Starting Cooperation

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Set of at least 70 groups by business activity in the country (for the first cohort)
- Presence of a regional operator company (like LLC "ERAITI")
- Regulator readiness for technical integration

**Process:**
1. Fund registers a legal entity in the regulator's special economic zone
2. Deploys DLE platform on local hosting
3. Attracts entrepreneurs through acceleration program
4. After gathering groups, approaches regulator with cooperation proposal
